# Project Descriptions
Air Quality Regression: Uses Linear Regression to predict the air quality index (AQI) in Utah

Decision Tree Model: applies a decision tree classification model to optimize a sales outreach strategy. Using a cost-benefit framework and predictive modeling, the analysis determines which potential customers should be contacted to maximize profit and improve efficiency in sales operations.

Game Day (SuperBowl) Analytics: performed EDA and created models from analyzed around 125,000 tweets to extract insights on ad performance, influence, and audience engagement.

High-Level Exploratory Data Analysis: explores a U.S. census dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover key insights and prepare the data for future modeling. The goal is to understand demographic and socioeconomic patterns and identify factors that may influence specific outcomes. Tasks include data cleaning, feature exploration, visualization, and encoding categorical variables for use in machine learning pipelines.

Movie Web Application: builded a movie information website with user authentication, dynamic movie listings, and administrative tools for managing movie data. The application supports two roles: Customer and Admin, each with distinct access levels and functionality.

Retail Cluster Analysis: Selected appropriate variables for a cluster analysis. Fitted and adjusted a cluster analysis model based on similar customer behavioral patterns. Interpreted the output of the model
